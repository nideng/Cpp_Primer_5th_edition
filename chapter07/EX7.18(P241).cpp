/*
encapsulation is the separation of implementation from interface. 
It hides the implementation details of a type. 
(In C++, encapsulation is enforced by putting the implementation in the
private part of a class)

Important advantages:

1. User code cannot inadvertently corrupt the state of an encapsulation object.
2. The implementation of an encapsulated class can change over time without 
   requiring changes in user-level code.
