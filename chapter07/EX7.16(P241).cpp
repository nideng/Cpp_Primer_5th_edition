There are no restrictions on how often an access specifier may appear.
The specified access level remains in effect until the next access specifier or
the end of the class body.
The members which are accessible to all parts of the program should define after
a public specifier.
The members which are accessible to the member functions of the class but are 
not accessible to code that uses the class should define after a private specifier.
