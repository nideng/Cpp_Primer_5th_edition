/*
A class member that is associated with the class,
rather than with individual objects of the class type.

What are the advantages of static members?
each object can no need to store a common data.
And if the data is changed, each object can use the new value.

How do they differ from ordinary members?
a static data member can have incomplete type.
we can use a static member as a default argument.
