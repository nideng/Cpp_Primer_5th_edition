/*
a) 
A class must provide at least one constructor. 
(untrue, "The compiler-generated constructor is known as 
the synthesized default constructor.")
b) 
A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
(untrue, A default constructor is a constructor that is used if no 
initializer is supplied.What's more, A constructor that supplies default 
arguments for all its parameters also defines the default constructor)
c) 
If there are no meaningful default values for a class, 
the class should not provide a default constructor. 
(untrue, the class should provide.)
d)
If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
one that initializes each data member to the default value of its
associated type. (untrue, only if our class does not explicitly define 
any constructors, the compiler will implicitly define the default
constructor for us.)
