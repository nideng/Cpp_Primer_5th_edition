/*
friend is a mechanism by which a class grants access to its nonpublic members.
They have the same rights as members.

Pros:
the useful functions can refer to class members in the class scope without needing
to explicitly prefix them with the class name.
you can access all the nonpublic members conveniently.
sometimes, more readable to the users of class.

Cons:
lessens encapsulation and therefore maintainability.
code verbosity, declarations inside the class, outside the class.
