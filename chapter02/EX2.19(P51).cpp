/*
definition:
the pointer is "points to" any other type.
the reference is "another name" of an object.

key difference :
a reference is another name of an already existing object.a pointer is an object in its own right.
Once initialized, a reference remains bound to its initial object.There is no way to rebind
a reference to refer to a different object.a pointer can be assignedand copied.
a reference always get the object to which the reference was initially bound.a single pointer 
can point to several different objects over its lifetime.
a reference must be initialized.a pointer need not be initialized at the time it is defined.
