/*
The destructor is a member function with the
name of the class prefixed by a tilde(~).

As with the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator, 
for some classes, the synthesized destructor is defined to disallow
objects of the type from being destoryed. Otherwise, the synthesized
destructor has an empty function body.

The compiler defines a synthesized destructor for any class that does
not define its own destructor.
