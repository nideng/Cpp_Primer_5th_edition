/*
The copy-assignment operator is function named operator= and takes an 
argument of the same type as the class.

This operator is used when assignment occurred.

The synthesized copy-assignment operator assigns each nonstatic member of
the right-hand object to corresponding member of the left-hand object using
the copy-assignment operator for the type of that member.

It is synthesized when the class does not define its own.
