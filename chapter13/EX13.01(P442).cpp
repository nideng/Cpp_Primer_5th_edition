the class type and any additional parameters have default values.

When copy initialization happens and that copy initialization requires either
the copy constructor or the move constructor.

1.Define variables using an =
2.Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
3.Return an object from a function that has a nonreference return type
4.Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class
5.Some class types also use copy initialization for the objects they allocate.
