/*
q and r:
Memory leakage happens. Because after r = q was executed,
no pointer points to the int r had pointed to.
It implies that no chance to free the memory for it.

q2 and r2:
It's safe. Because after 'r2 = q2', the reference 
count belongs to r2 reduce to 0 and the reference count
belongs to q2 increase to 2, then the memory allocated by
r2 will be released automatically.
